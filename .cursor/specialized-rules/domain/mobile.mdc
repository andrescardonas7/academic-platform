## Mobile / React Native Guidelines

### Project Structure
- Keep mobile code in `apps/mobile/` (Monorepo) or its own repo.
- Use TypeScript throughout.

### Styling
- Use **StyleSheet.create** or Tailwind-RN; never inline magic numbers.
- Leverage platform-specific files (`Component.ios.tsx`, `Component.android.tsx`).

### Performance
- Enable Hermes engine.
- Use FlatList with keyExtractor for large lists.
- Avoid anonymous functions in render paths.

### Native Modules
- Prefer community packages; if writing native code, follow repo's code style.

### CI
- Run E2E with Detox; build & test on both iOS and Android.
